# Module_4_Challenge
# In this challenge, the user is prompted to explore a data set sourced from an e-commerce store. The user is then prompted to clean up the data and make it make sense.
# The data has collumns that track different elements from the business. Such as id, date, price of item, weight of item, qty per order, shipping, total cost and profit. Having an account of these metrics gives the business owner the ability to see how the operations is doing from different perspectives. 
# The user tracks the top 5 clients, their orders, and profit margit. This analysis is important because it can show the business owner where they are doing well and where they can potentially improve. Since there was such a gap between the top 1 client and the rest. It would be worthwile to see what straetgy is being used with client (1) that may be able to transfer over to other business clients.
